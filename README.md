# Fallback Domain Redirect with UTM Parameters Plugin
Description
-----------
This [YOURLS](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS#readme) plugin allows your YOURLS site to work double-duty. While still allowing you to create shortlinks as normal, it also allows you to to use the domain of your link shortener as a wildcard redirect to your main site.

###  What this plugin does
- **Redirects the original URL to the fallback domain like a wildcard redirect**
- **Adds UTM parameters** (optional) - utm_source, utm_medium & utm_campaign can be set and added upon redirect to the fallback domain.
- Removes any UTM parameters if present before redirecting to the fallback domain. But only if UTM parameters are set.
- If the sho.rt keyword exists, it doesn't interfere.

##### Example

Say your main website is: https://www.BillysTenneesseEmporium.com/

On the other hand, the domain for your YOURLS domain is: https://BTEmp.com

If you're on the go, at an event or simply posting on a forum, a shorter easy-to-spell domain might be appreciated. Using this plugin, and without having to set up a shortlink before hand, you could make the following wildcard redirect:
BTEmp.com/weddings/bouquets/arrangement-[1] â†´
https://www.BillysTenneesseEmporium.com/weddings/bouquet/arrangement-[1]/?utm_source=BTEmp.com&utm_medium=YOURLS

It certainly is convenient for one-time use URLS to write on the back of a business card or whatever. The UTM source is optional and to allow the user to see how much use they're getting out of method, and to distinguish it from direct traffic.

Also, keep in mind that **you still get to keep using your YOURLS install like you always have**. This plugin doesn't interfere in any way with short links to existing keywords.
